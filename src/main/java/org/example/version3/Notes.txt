-> Features of Vertx
Vert.x's event-driven and non-blocking I/O model is the key feature that enables it to handle the scenario of multiple clients sending requests to a server concurrently. Here's how Vert.x's key features contribute to handling such scenarios effectively:

1. Event-Driven Architecture:
Vert.x is built on an event-driven architecture. It uses an event loop to handle incoming requests asynchronously. This allows Vert.x to process multiple requests concurrently without blocking, making it ideal for scenarios with a high volume of incoming requests.
2. Non-Blocking I/O:
Vert.x performs I/O operations in a non-blocking manner. When a request requires I/O, instead of blocking until the operation completes, Vert.x employs callbacks or reactive patterns to continue processing other requests. This enables Vert.x to utilize resources efficiently and handle a large number of concurrent connections.
3. Reactive Programming:
Vert.x promotes a reactive programming style, where components react to changes or events in a non-blocking way. This makes it easier to write scalable and responsive applications that can handle multiple requests concurrently.
4. Verticles and Vertical Scaling:
Vert.x applications are composed of verticles, which are lightweight units of execution. Each verticle can handle a specific task, such as processing requests or managing connections. Vert.x supports vertical scaling, allowing you to deploy multiple instances of verticles to distribute the workload and handle more concurrent requests.
5. Built-in Clustering Support:
Vert.x provides built-in support for clustering, which allows multiple Vert.x instances to form a cluster and work together. This feature enables horizontal scaling, where you can add more instances to the cluster to handle an increasing number of concurrent requests.
6. Efficient Resource Management:
Vert.x is designed to be lightweight and efficient in resource usage. It minimizes thread usage through its event loop and asynchronous operations, allowing it to handle a large number of connections with relatively low resource overhead.
Conclusion:
The combination of Vert.x's event-driven architecture, non-blocking I/O, reactive programming model, support for clustering, and efficient resource management makes it well-suited for handling scenarios where multiple clients send requests to a server concurrently. By leveraging these features, Vert.x enables developers to build highly scalable and responsive applications that can efficiently handle varying levels of incoming traffic.

Achieving 10 Persistent Connections:
To establish persistent connections with 10 clients:

Each client can establish a TCP connection to the server on port 8888.
The server, using NetServer and NetSocket, can handle incoming connections and communicate independently with each client over its respective NetSocket.
By differentiating between client connections, the server can manage and process messages from each client independently, allowing for 10 simultaneous persistent connections.
Using NetServer and NetSocket in Vert.x provides a low-level TCP protocol-based approach for establishing persistent connections and handling bidirectional communication between a server and multiple clients effectively.
